# Miniproject 2

### [Assignment](assignment.md)

## Project/Goals
The goal is to pull data from API's of a specific area, parse them, put the parsed data into dictionaries, and then compare the data given by each API.

## Process
### pull data from APIs
### parse data into multiple dictionaries (at least that's what I wanted to do before the major roadblock :( )
### compare results of APIs used with SQL

## Results
Coverage seems good? I noticed that the Foursquare API doesn't have ratings listed in the area I chose.

## Challenges 
Both API's weren't working for me at first. Got the foursquare API to work but by the time I got to the Yelp API I ran out of time trying to figure out why it wasn't working for me.

## Future Goals
get the code to actually work for me (i tried googling but the answers it was giving me were what i was doing and i couldn't find another solution)
